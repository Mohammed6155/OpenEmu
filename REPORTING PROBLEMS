Do not follow tutorials found on YouTube and Reddit as they are often wrong.
Do not post links or refer to copyright infringing ROM and ISO sites.

If keyboard and/or gamepad are not working, read the guide on input troubleshooting in the original OpenEmu repository for a solution.

NDS games (especially Bomberman and Pokemon) may have unsolvable problems related to AP patches or DeSmuME's JIT dynarec. Alternatively, try standalone DeSmuME that has the JIT dynarec off by default which may improve compatibility.
Arcade/MAME is unsupported because it is an experimental core port and has inherent usability and maintainability issues. It is recommended to use the official standalone version and to read this helpful MAME ROMs tutorial.
Cheat code support is not available for all systems, as noted in the cheat codes guide. I know cheat code support is available for all systems in RetroArch.
